* Fix - Updated all Javascript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.

= 2.1.2 - 2013/04/12 =
* Tweak - Added when install and activate plugin link redirects to License Key validation page instead of the wp-plugins dashboard.
* Fix - Link from search box drop down footer to All Results Search pages not working in Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 10.

When a sites custom permalinks where set with a trailing slash this caused an extra / in the Results Search pages URL resulting in a 404. The plugin now checks if the trailing slash is present and allows for that to produce the correct URL.

= 2.1.0 - 2013/03/22 =
* Feature - Newly developed mysql command that makes the Predictive Search Engine results 100% accurate, 100% of the time. Install this upgrade and try it out for yourself - you will be absolutely amazed, excited, over the moon like we are about it.
* Tweak -Jumped version from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0 with the release of the Predictive Search engine 100% accurate search results upgrade.
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing search results to show a -1 in the drop down instead of the results because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Predictive Search now automatically detects that and works as it should.

= 2.0.1 - 2013/03/15 =
* Feature - All Results search page shortcode now shows as an image in the Search results page Visual text editor instead of the shortcode [woocommerce_search]. We have used an image to overcome some confusion about if the shortcode was a3rev Predictive Search or a WooCommerce shortcode function. Also has instructions (in English) about moving the shortcode to another page. After you upgrade, take a look.
* Fix - All Results search page breaking in some themes when the show Add to Cart button with search results feature is activated. Please update to this version now if you are experiencing this issue and this will fix it.
* Fix - Search function and shortcodes not working on themes that call the wpautop function before the shortcode function (very poor practice). The wpautop function auto adds the <p> tag to all white space in php functions and thus breaks our function. We use internal script rather than a js file for the serach function and shortcodes because a js file is always called on each page load even when it is not required. We have removed all white spaces and problem no longer exists.

= 2.0 - 2013/02/28 =
* Feature - Updated all plugin code to be WooCommerce V2.0 compatible with backward compatibility.
* Feature - Added Predictive Search 'Focus keywords'. As a solution for all the people who have requested all the different things they want Predictive Search to return results for and from. Now you can 100% accurately Optimize your entire site anyway you want with WooCommerce Predictive Search 'Focus Keywords' and Optimize your 'site search' by adding a 'Focus Keywords or Keyword Phrases' to any product page, post, wp-page just like an SEO plugin except it is for site search not external search engines and its 100% accurate and super fast.
* Feature - Added a new Predictive Search meta section on each product page, post and page for setting 'Focus Keywords and Keyword Phrases'.
* Feature - Exclude any product, post or page from Predictive Search results right from the Predictive Search Meta. Also see if it is currently excluded from search results, make it visible from the meta box.
* Feature - Integration with SEO plugins. Can be a massive time saver. Configure your plugin with the click of a mouse to use Focus Keywords that are set on an SEO plugin you are using. Added the ability for to also include any 'Focus Keywords' that have been set while optimizing the site content for search engine search.
* Feature - Currently supports Yoasts WordPress SEO and the All in One SEO plugins. We have built this feature so we can add any SEO plugin that uses 'Focus Keywords'. If you use another WordPress SEO Plugin and would like to see it included in the list of supported plugins please just let us know and we will look in including support for it in future updates.

* Feature - Added the ability to add text content that shows inside the Search box. Added as a Global setting or can be individually set on Widgets, Shortcode or the Search Function

It now has its own nav bar just like the WooCommerce Payment gateways tab. The tabs are É. Settings | All Results Search Pages | Exclude Content | Search Function, with styling to be added in the next feature upgrade.
* Feature - Added a new styling lib for drop-downs and Options Ð this was important because it now uses the same lib as WooCommerce uses Ð makes excluding content a very easy thing to do for each content search taxonomy.
* Fix - Sort Search Results Pages show 'No Results' - The way the plugin was configured when a user hit 'Enter' while searching all of the Search Results pages where displayed for Sorting - Sort by Product Name | SKU | Product Categories | Product Tags | Posts | Pages - All of the Tabs showed even if a page had 'No Results'. This was done to save on database queries. We have written a special script and added it is fired when the user clicks 'Enter' while searching - it checks each page for results - if it finds 'No Results' it hides the Page tab and if it finds results if does nothing, when it is finished doing the 6 queries it goes back to sleep. The result is only 6 extra queries being done and super fast and only shows pages that have results.
