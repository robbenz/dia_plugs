ImageRecycle pdf & image compression. Make your WordPress website load faster by using an automatic image and pdf optimization.

== Description ==

**ImageRecycle is an automatic Image and PDF content optimizer for WordPress website.** Your customers are waiting for your pages to load, it can takes long, especially on mobile devices. Even content is served in seconds by a fast server, slow connection can make your users leaving.

People are impatient in front a slow loading website, that's the result of all studies; 4 second loading causing 24% of visitors to leave (Source statistica.com.). Image and PDF optimization is more efficient than any other optimization tool.
Images can represent from 60% to 80% of a page weight, so an optimization can accelerate your page loading by x3 or more.

### WordPress image optimization

It's highly important in WordPress to make an image optimization because when you upload an image, 4 images are generated and stored on your server: a thumbnail, medium, large and original sized images.
Even more, some plugin can add their own image size for specific layouts like WooCommerce. All those images can be used in various conditions, it's easy but heavy to load. 
Image optimization with ImageRecycle plugin is automatic and reduce your page weight by up to 80%. This is highly recommended for SEO and high traffic websites.

More case studies available here: https://www.imagerecycle.com/case-studies

Plus, our WordPress plugin is fully using the WordPress framework to be as easy and fast as possible.

### We reduce image and pdf, not quality

The jpg, png, gif optimization algorithm is capable of reducing the image size by up to 85% (5x +), while the resulting photos are visually identical to the originals. We believe that image and pdf compression is a matter preserving the quality then reduce the size. 
Reducing the image and pdf size can be done using a massive compression of data and result a worsened quality. We detect already compressed media and return original files.

### WooCommerce and third party plugin compatible

The plugin is highly configurable and you can choose media from any folder on your server.
So it will work with all third party plugins including WooCommerce. Plus, you can of course optimize media from other folders (multiple site, other CMS...)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the pdf image optimization process, where are going my media? =
The plugin will send your media on our cloud optimizer, then replace the original image with the optimized image. 
Our server is  a dedicated high speed server that host the optimization algorythm.
Like some others plugin we don't do any optimization process on YOUR server, it would be either not very effiscient or it would slow down a lot your server.

= Do I have a backup of my image and PDF? =
Yes, we keep a backup of your original files during one month on a dedicated storage server. You can revert your original files in one click during this month.
Like some others plugin we don't use YOUR server to do backup, it slow down your website and charge your server with unnecessary media.

= Should I select best saving or original quality to optimize my media? =
It depends on the compression you need. Best saving has a better compression level than lossless compression. 
The resulting image is not 100% identical with the original even if most of the time it's not visible. 
Globally use Best saving for a final usage of your image and Original quality if you've planned to make treatment later on images (with Photoshop for example).

= I don't want to optimize all my media or not at the same quality =
You can exclude some media from optimization with a server folder exclusion. Plus, each media optimization has a setting of quality of compression.
* JPG image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression
* PNG image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression
* GIF image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression
* PDF image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression

= Can I test the service? =
Yes, there a trial version during 15 days for 100MB of media optimization available. Just register an account from the plugin after install and start image optimization.

= Can I use the service on multiple site? =
It's possible of course and there's a special tool for that. 
To make image optimization you got a main account with a key and secret. From the website you can create free and unlimited sub accounts with, if you want, a limited quota.
Or you can just use your main account key and secret on all your website, it's up to you :)

= Why do I need an API key? =
ImageRecycle Image and PDF Optimizer uses advanced algorithm to optimize images. The algorithm is hosted on a high speed dedicated server.
The API key and secret is like a login that control that you are allowed to use this server.

= Where do I get my API key? =
To get your API key, just create a free account from the plugin (key is added automatically) or create one from www.imagerecycle.com. 
After a key and secret are added image optimization can start and available quota is displayed in Setting > ImageRecycle menu

= Are my images safe? =
Yes, privacy is a priority. The ImageRecycle server encryption doesn't allow anyone to access your media.

= Will ImageRecycle optimization work if my website is using a CDN (like CloudFare or Maxxcdn)? =
Yes, the pdf & image optimization will be done without interfering with the CDN.

 = Will ImageRecycle optimization work with WordPress cache plugins? =
Sure, and it's even recommended to use one to speed up even more your WordPress install!

== Upgrade Notice ==

**Uninstall old version, re-install the new version**

== Requirements ==

= Compression technical details =

**The jpg optimization** tool is capable of reducing the file size of standard JPEG photos by up to 85% (5x +), while the resulting photos are visually identical to the original photos.
The script on the server is making a full analysis of:
* Colors radius sizes
* Textures
* Patterns

**For .png and gif images optimization**, it's quite different, we use several methods.
* Quantization
* Choosing a better pre-compression filter
* Deflate compression algorithm enhancement

**We also offer a PDF compression** specifically optimized for web-based publication. 
The quality for reading a PDF on the web will be close to the original. Depending of the tool and the quality setting used to generate the PDF, you can expect from 10% to 95%. 
Exceptional compression results can be applied on PDF exported for print using Adobe Indesign for example.

Optimizations are:

* Image optimization
* Colors resolution reduction for grayscale, bi-tonal images and indexed images
* Color conversion
* Subsetting of fonts
* Removal of embedded standard fonts
* Removal redundant objects
* Remove alternative images
* Remove metadata
* Resize image at exact size

Once the script detect some elements that can be optimized it runs the optimization on image zone that are mostly invisible to human eye.
We also eliminate non-standard elements added by some image software such as photoshop or Gimp. This process is completelly lossy and can be reverted.
